# Park Scene Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for the development and enhancement of the park scene environment in the French Bulldog and Owner 3D modeling project.

## Overview

The park scene creates a natural environment for the dog and owner models, providing context and enhancing the visual appeal of the project. The scene is generated programmatically using Three.js and can be customized with various parameters.

## Components

### Ground

- **Material**: Green grass texture with slight terrain variation
- **Size**: Customizable (default: 20x20 units)
- **Features**: Slight height variation at the edges for natural look

### Trees

- **Quantity**: Customizable (default: 8)
- **Placement**: Positioned around the perimeter of the scene
- **Components**: 
  - Trunk: Brown cylindrical shape
  - Foliage: Stacked cones with forest green color
- **Variation**: Random rotation and scaling for natural appearance

### Bushes

- **Quantity**: Customizable (default: 12)
- **Placement**: Scattered throughout the scene, avoiding the center
- **Style**: Spherical shapes with varied sizes
- **Color**: Deep green for visual distinction from trees

### Pathway

- **Shape**: Semi-circular
- **Material**: Gray stone texture
- **Position**: Placed off-center to create visual interest
- **Purpose**: Visual element that guides camera movement

### Benches

- **Quantity**: 3 (default)
- **Placement**: Along the pathway
- **Components**:
  - Seat: Wooden texture
  - Backrest: Matching wood material
  - Legs: Metal material
- **Facing**: Oriented toward the center of the scene

### Sky

- **Type**: Sky dome (hemisphere)
- **Color**: Light blue
- **Function**: Provides background and atmosphere

### Lighting

- **Main light**: Directional light simulating the sun
- **Fill light**: Secondary softer lights for shadow reduction
- **Shadows**: Cast by all elements for realism

## Implementation

The park scene is implemented in the `ParkSceneCreator` class with these key methods:

- `createParkScene()`: Creates the complete park environment
- `createGround()`: Creates the grassy ground plane
- `createSkyBox()`: Creates the sky backdrop and main lighting
- `createTrees()`: Generates and places trees
- `createBushes()`: Generates and places bushes
- `createPathway()`: Creates the stone pathway
- `createBenches()`: Places benches along the pathway

## Configuration Options

The park scene can be customized using the following options:

```javascript
parkScene.createParkScene({
    groundSize: 20,     // Size of the ground plane
    treesCount: 8,      // Number of trees
    bushesCount: 12,    // Number of bushes
    addBenches: true,   // Whether to add benches
    addPathway: true,   // Whether to add a pathway
    skyBox: true        // Whether to create a sky backdrop
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Use appropriate polygon counts for trees and bushes
   - Limit the number of elements for better performance
   - Use instancing for repeated elements when possible

2. **Visual Balance**:
   - Maintain clear space in the center for the models
   - Create visual interest with varied element placement
   - Ensure lighting complements the models

3. **Scale Appropriateness**:
   - Ensure park elements are properly scaled relative to the models
   - Dog model should be approximately 0.3-0.4 units high
   - Human model should be approximately 1.7 units high
   - Trees should be 3-4 units high

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the park scene include:

- Texture mapping for more realistic surfaces
- Water features (pond, fountain)
- Dynamic time-of-day lighting
- Animated elements (swaying trees, flowing water)
- Weather effects (rain, snow)
- Additional park elements (playground, picnic area)

## Integration with Models

When placing models in the park scene:

1. Position the models on the ground plane
2. Orient them to interact naturally with the environment
3. Ensure models cast and receive shadows for realism
4. Consider the relationship between models and scene elements
5. Use the debug mode to verify proper positioning and scale
